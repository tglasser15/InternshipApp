<h2>Internship Mobile App with Twitter API Integration</h2> <br>
<h3> User Notes</h3>
<i>This is a currently active project and will be a continued project as part of the Mobile App Development course I am currently taking. Some of the features of the project are unusable as of 3/28/14. The project will be repeatedly updated over the course of the next two months, the ending of the course. <br>

<i>For this project, I have only included Twitter API integration. <b>The results of the tweets shown in the application are random tweets I created on a "fake" account on twitter for testing purposes</b> I am waiting to speak with my schools' Career Services to talk about posting internships in a way I can pull them onto the mobile app; my hope is to include more API's so I can pull from as many sources as I can.

This application allows users to be able to efficiently search for internships either by a manual search or filter search by field of interest (major) or location interested in interning at. The main application page includes the following features:
<ul>
	<li><b>Search for internships</b> - allows user to search for internships using several filtering criteria. Recent internships posted by Career Services</li>
    <li><b>Bookmarks</b></li>
    <li><b>Saved Searches</b></li>
</ul>
